# Omnibus

!!! abstract

    OpenMEV employs a fault-tolerant architecture with independent services interacting with one another to provide a composable transaction queue, order management system with a price-time priority matching engine. 

## OpenMEV Platform Documentation

- End User information

- Searcher Integration

- Technical: Technical overview on specific category

!!! note 

    There are three categories of services provided by OpenMEV
    Application Services, Infrastructure Services, Tracing Services. 
    The application services implement the business logic of the underlying platform, while the infrastructure services support the distributed environment under which the application services run and collaborate with one another.

### SushiSwap

The SushiSwap integration provides a service that realizes profit by transaction batching for the
purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool and thus give away the
arbitrage, front-running, back-running opportunities to miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a credibly neutral platform that enables aggregation of transactions (batching) for
the purposes of extracting MEV profits and returning them back to the traders.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality is having a clear
and comprehensive rule book that regulates off-chain behavior and activities. Our assumption
concerning governance is that methods and processes that work in legacy markets may not be
applicable in adversarial environments such as permissionless blockchains. With that understanding
it is important not to rely solely on such systems and mechanics long term.
